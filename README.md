# Image Gallery

This project was made for the HNG Internship stage 3.

## Features

The aim of the app is to display a collection of images. think unsplash or pexels. It's major features include:-

1. Display images in a grid layout
2. Allow users search for images by the tags related to them
3. Images can be re-arranged i.e. dragged and dropped
4. display an error message when an error occurs i.e. no images relating to the searched tag
5. An authentication feature for users before accessing the gallery

## Getting Started

the app is very easy to use. it does not require any external APIs or other applications. the login email and password are given below

- Email: user@example.com
- Password: 1Password

## Limitations

there are no major limitations/bugs on the app. however like evry application, it can be upgraded to be better. such upgrades include:-

- a larger collection of images.
- a database where the images can be fetched from so loading is faster
